# Shen to Rust Transpiler

## Project Overview

This project is a transpiler that converts Shen programming language code to Rust, enabling interoperability between these two functional programming languages.

## Key Features

- Parse Shen source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Convert Shen language constructs to equivalent Rust representations
- Support for:
  - Function definitions
  - Lambda expressions
  - Conditional statements
  - Basic data types
  - List operations

## Project Goals

- Provide a bridge between Shen's expressive functional paradigms and Rust's systems programming capabilities
- Enable gradual migration of Shen codebases to Rust
- Explore type system and language translation techniques

## Current Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§
- Basic parsing implemented
- Initial code generation support
- Ongoing development of language construct mapping

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain
- Cargo package manager

### Build
```bash
